## Project Overview
This project focuses on the exploration and visualization of a car dataset to analyze key automotive trends. The dataset includes various attributes such as vehicle make, model, year, engine specifications, pricing, and fuel efficiency. Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, we performed extensive data exploration to uncover insights about car pricing, engine performance, and market trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Brand Analysis:** Grouped and ranked car brands by their average MSRP.
- **Visualization:**
- **Bar Charts:** Used to show the average price per brand and per vehicle size.
- **Line Charts:** Added a secondary line plot on bar charts to visualize additional data like car count per brand.
- **Scatter Plots:** Explored the correlation between `Engine HP` and `MSRP`, categorized by `Vehicle Size`.
- **Histograms:** Examined the price distribution of vehicles.
- **Count Plots:** Displayed the frequency of different transmission types, ordered by popularity.
- **Pie Charts:** Visualized categorical distributions such as `Engine Fuel Type`.
- **Statistical Insights:** Added reference lines (e.g., average count lines in bar charts) to enhance interpretation.
